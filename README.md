<li>Percent funded</li>
<li>Average donation</li>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Sub-category</li>
<li>Date created conversion</li>
<li>Date ended conversion</li>

A pivot table and stacked column charts were used to visualize count total of successful, failed, cancelled, or live campaigns. The pivot table could be filtered by country. A table was created demonstrating the mean, median, min, max, and stdev using formulas.

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
